## How to run the project
The project is version controlled using a wrapper repository (the one that contains this README file) over two modules (one for the frontend and one from the backend).
- after cloning the [wrapper repository](https://github.com/Radu-Vele/Bike_Sharing_System) run the following commands to clone the modules for the frontend and backend:
    - `git submodule init`
    - `git submodule update`
- make sure you are on the `main` branch in each repo.

### MySQL DataBase
- one needs to setup a local database schema using MySQL and edit the username and password in `src/main/resources/application.properties`. This can be done directly from IntelliJ [see documentation](jetbrains.com/help/idea/mysql.html).
- currently, the app does not offer a server side so the database can only be populated using Postman and the requests defined in the controller package in the backend.

### Backend using IntelliJ
The steps are described below:
- import project from existing sources (select the backend folder)
- setup the SDK (Java 17 is recommended)
- setup maven: in Maven Settings/ set the maven home path to Bundled (Maven 3)
- make sure all dependencies are resolved and run the `@SpringBootApplication` from `SeProjectBackendApplication.java`.

### Frontend using VSCode
- open a terminal in the project directory and run the commands `npm install` and `npm start`.
- make sure to open the `localhost:3000` in incognito mode (Google Chrome is used during development) with CORS enabled.
